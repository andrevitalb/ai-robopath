# Intelligent Robot

In this final version of the program, the robot makes its decisions based on **its actual position, the position of the reward, and the position of the penalty**. As the grid works with coordinates, the agent decides whether to go one direction or any other, always trying to get as close as possible to the reward, maintaining its distance from the penalty.


This series of programs were made under as a project for the [Universidad Aut√≥noma de Aguascalientes](https://www.uaa.mx/)
