# Bellman Robot

This is the second version of the program. In this version, the steps are calculated with the **Bellman equation**. This version was taken from [Roberto Rama's Pacman GitHub project](https://github.com/ramaroberto/pacman), so all credits to him.

Here's a screenshot of the program execution without parameters:
