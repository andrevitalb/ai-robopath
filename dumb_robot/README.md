# Dumb Robot

This is the starting version (or the first level). In this version, all decisions made by the agent are completely random.

There is just one input value to this program: *the number of tests or robots desired to run*.

When the input is entered, the program starts to run *n* tests, printing each movement the robot makes, alongside its current position.

Each time a robot either gets to the reward or the penalty, the execution will do a quick stop, showing the final result on screen, to the continue with the remaining tests.

When the execution is completed, the program displays a message, showing how many robots lost, how many won and, if any robot won, it displays also the paths used by the winners.
